          <p class="mb-0"></p>Sometimes a quick video is better than a long text. So check the video I have made for the <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/library/uc-library-news/2020/visualise-your-thesis-competition.html">2020 Visualise Your Thesis</a> competition in the local heat of my University. </p>

          <p class="mb-2"></p> <b> Thesis Project in a few words </b>
          <p class="mb-0"></p>More precisely in my project, I am investigating the availability of light for coastal ecosystems overall New Zealand, especially underwater forests. I am making use of the remote sensing of light via satellites and drones as well as optical modelling and in-situ measurements. The knowledge gained from these new technologies helps me developping methods to efficiently monitor the light environment around the coasts. </p>
          <p class="mb-0"></p>I am furthermore interested in how a change in the light environment drives valuable communities to shift towards alternative ones. The reason is that these shifts are usually accompanied with a loss of services that the previous state of the ecosystem was providing us. Long story short, this is about understanding what we can potential loose by continuing changing our marine environment and more importantly, what can we do to protect what we benefit from. </p>
          <p class="mb-0"></p>As an example, there are amazing and very valuable underwater forests around New Zealand. These forests are mainly dominated by kelp species, which are macroalgae that can grow BIG depending on the species. Associated with these underwater forests are many other species, some of economical interest such as the rock lobster or the p&#257ua, the local abalone. Unfortunately and so are the forests in land, the kelp forests are locally and globally declining due to different factors including marine heat waves, storms and waves or sedimentation. The goal of my study is to investigate how a change of the light availability at the bottom of the sea is influencing the valuable underwater forests. </p>

          <p class="mb-0"></p>So a big part of my project is to use satellite data to estimate the amounf of light reaching the seabed or seafloor. This is important as the light reaching the bottom of the sea will then be available for underwater forests. The good thing about using satellite data is that they have been collecting data for a few decades now (depending on the satellite itself), so we can have an idea if there has been more or less light for the underwater forests these past decades. We can also investigate why. </p>
          <p class="mb-0"></p>The gifs below show of the average daily light reaching the seabed for every months, estimated by satellite and for the North and South Island of New Zealand. The blue/purple colours mean almost no light whereas the green/yellow/red colours mean potentially enough light to sustain photosynthesis and productive underwater forests. </p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <img src="img/Ebedv2018_MonthlyMeans_maxRes_NorthIsland_RevCol.gif" alt="xx. The data are derived from the satellite Aqua (MODIS)." />

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="mb-0"></p> One apparent feature is the extension and retraction of the illuminated seabed, pulsing throughout the seasons. There is obviously more light reaching the seabed durign Summer than Winter. We can also see from the maps above that there is quite a bit of change in space and time of the amount of light reaching the seabed apart from the seasonal aspect. A goal of the thesis is to explore what is causing this variability.  </p>

        <div> Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have increased worldwide in intensity, frequency, and duration, often with severe impacts on ecologically and socio-economically important coastal habitats. Most MHW studies have focused on summer events in specific regions or global open-water analyses with little consideration to seasonality or spatial biogeography of the nearshore zone. We address this research gap by analysing changes to MHWs across seasons and ecoregions, within 12 nautical miles (NM) of New Zealand’s coastline, an area with high biodiversity and endemism. We used season-specific linear trend analysis with temporal breakpoints between 1982 and 2021 to identify the number of MHW events and MHW days, and mean, maximum, and cumulative intensity of MHWs for New Zealand coastal ecoregions. Across ecoregions, 69.5% of 200 trend analyses increased significantly whereas the remaining 30.5% were unaffected. For the significant increases, temporal breakpoints occurred between 1994 and 2012. We conclude that MHWs have become stronger, longer and more frequent across coastal New Zealand, but with some variability within and between regions. Our trend-analyses could enable retrospective analyses of biological tipping-points and inform management practices that may enhance the resilience of ecoregions yet to face MHW breakpoints or those in the initial stages of major climatic changes.

        <div> Compromised light quantity on the seabed affects the composition and resilience of marine forests and the maintenance of ecosystem services. However, the response of macroalgal assemblages to changes in the quality (spectral composition) of light as compared to the quantity alone is poorly understood. Here, we bridge radiative transfer modeling and algal physiology to simulate the underwater light environment and explore macroalgal responses to spectral attenuation by various coastal water constituents. We considered three groups of macroalgal taxa (class Phaeophyceae and, phyla Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta) for which we developed a “synthetic envelope” of spectrally resolved action spectra using 1 million radiative simulations. We found that brown algae were more efficient at harvesting light across the whole spectrum at low attenuation (< 0.2 m−1) when depths were greater than 10 m, whereas green algae dominated shallower depths than 10 m for low to high attenuation values. Finally, red algae made best use of the available light at relatively higher attenuation values (> 0.2 m−1) and deeper depths. We also demonstrated that the brown and green algal taxa showed higher photosynthetic efficiencies when attenuation was dominated by particulate matter rather than by phytoplankton or detrital matter. Our results shed new light on the “Complementary Chromatic Adaptation” hypothesis by confirming that algal pigmentation matters under a subset of scenarios, particularly at the limits of light availability in coastal waters. This study paves the way for identifying competitive thresholds in macroalgal communities by using satellite-derived ocean color products to identify regions and depths of potential optical transitions.

        <div> With climate heating, Aotearoa New Zealand is expected to experience more marine heatwaves (MHW) in the coming decades. These extreme events are already impacting the island nation's marine and coastal environments and marine industries at a variety of scales. There will potentially be substantial benefits in developing an early warning system–specifically ocean seasonal forecast tools. This near-term 2,030 horizon scan reviews studies supporting the development of this capability and notes work needed to enable stakeholders to benefit from this knowledge. Review findings congregate around six themes; (1) MHW impacts, (2) mechanistic understanding, (3) observational basis, (4) seasonal forecast tools, (5) supporting Te Tiriti (The Treaty of Waitangi) and Māori aspirations, and (6) end-user engagement. The primary recommendation is a cross-institutional, cross-sector MHW Taskforce that would address, in a coordinated and effective fashion, the real, multi-faceted challenges associated with the committed pathway of warming. A range of sub-recommendations follow that connect with the United Nations Ocean Decade initiative.

        <div> Marine heatwaves (MHWs) can cause dramatic changes to ecologically, culturally, and economically important coastal ecosystems. To date, MHW studies have focused on geographically isolated regions or broad-scale global oceanic analyses, without considering coastal biogeographical regions and seasons. However, to understand impacts from MHWs on diverse coastal communities, a combined biogeographical-seasonal approach is necessary, because (1) bioregions reflect community-wide temperature tolerances and (2) summer or winter heatwaves likely affect communities differently. We therefore carried out season-specific Theil–Sen robust linear regressions and Pettitt change point analyses from 1982 to 2021 on the number of events, number of MHW days, mean intensity, maximum intensity, and cumulative intensity of MHWs, for each of the world’s 12 major coastal biogeographical realms. We found that 70% of 240 trend analyses increased significantly, 5% decreased and 25% were unaffected. There were clear differences between trends in metrics within biogeographical regions, and among seasons. For the significant increases, most change points occurred between 1998 and 2006. Regression slopes were generally positive across MHW metrics, seasons, and biogeographical realms as well as being highest after change point detection. Trends were highest for the Arctic, Northern Pacific, and Northern Atlantic realms in summer, and lowest for the Southern Ocean and several equatorial realms in other seasons. Our analysis highlights that future case studies should incorporate break point changes and seasonality in MHW analysis, to increase our understanding of how future, 
          more frequent, and stronger MHWs will affect coastal ecosystems.

        <div> Ecologists traditionally study how contemporary local processes, such as biological interactions and physical stressors, affect the distribution and abundance of organisms. By comparison, biogeographers study the distribution of the same organisms, but focus on historic, larger-scale processes that can cause mass mortalities, such as earthquakes. Here we document cascading effects of rare biogeographical (seismic) and more common ecological (temperature-related) processes on the distribution and abundances of coastal foundation species. Intertidal wave-exposed rocky reefs around Kaikōura, New Zealand, dominated by large, long-lived, and iconic southern bull kelps (<i>Durvillaea antarctica </i> and <i>Durvillaea willana </i> ). In November 2016, a 7.8 Mw earthquake uplifted the coastline around Kaikōura by up to 2 m, and a year later the region experienced the hottest summer on record. Extensive sampling of intertidal communities over 15 km coastline were done shortly after the earthquake and heatwaves and 4 years after the earthquake. <i>Durvillaea </i> lost 75% of its canopy to uplift and the heatwaves reduced canopies that had survived the uplift by an additional 35%. The survey done 4 years after the earthquake showed that <i>Durvillaea </i>  had not recovered and that the intertidal zone in many places now was dominated by small turfs and foliose seaweed. Cascading impacts from seismic uplift and heatwaves have destroyed populations of <i>Durvillaea </i>  around Kaikōura. Surviving smaller and sparser <i>Durvillaea </i>  patches will likely compromise capacity for self-replacement and lower resilience to future stressors. These results are discussed in a global biogeographical-ecological context of seismic activity and extreme heatwaves and highlight that these events, which are not particularly rare in a geological context, may have common long-lasting ecological legacies.</div>

        <div> Marine heatwaves (MHW) are becoming stronger and more frequent across the globe. MHWs affect the thermal physiology of all biological organisms, but wider ecosystem effects are particularly impactful when large habitat-forming foundation species such as kelps are affected. Many studies on impacts from MHWs on kelps have focused on temperature effects in isolation, except for a few studies that have integrated co-occurring stress from grazers, wave exposure and nutrient limitation. It is likely that many stressors act in concert with MHWs and exacerbate their effects. Here we analyzed satellite images over 60 months to assess temporal changes in abundance of surface canopies of the giant kelp  <i>Macrocystis pyrifera </i> in the New Zealand coastal zone. The analysis encompassed the most extreme MHW on record (2017/18), across a 6° latitudinal gradient of four regions southward from the northern distributional limit of <i>Macrocystis </i> along mainland New Zealand. We tested the association of surface canopy cover of <i>Macrocystis </i> with sea surface temperature, temperature anomalies, chlorophyll-a (a proxy for nutrient availability) and water clarity (diffuse attenuation coefficient). We found a reduced cover of <i>Macrocystis </i> across all regions during and after the 2017/18 MHW, with least impact at the most southern region where the maximum temperatures did not exceed 18°C. There was also an important and significant interaction between temperature and water clarity, showing that temperature-induced kelp loss was greater when water clarity was poor. These results show that notable negative effects occurred across the coastal range of this foundation species and highlight the importance of studying MHW effects across latitudinal gradients and in concert with other co-occurring stressors.</div>

            <div> Our project is a coastal classification tool that automatically identifies appropriate seal habitat using very high resolution satellite imagery. The application displays an “attractiveness” score for each site on the image, which takes into consideration landscape features such as distance from cliffs and beach surface area, as well as historical presence/absence of seals at that site. The user will also add to the validity of the application by feeding in additional observation data, opening it to citizen science application.</div>
